# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I got up at 4AM to finish my remaining work.  I've really been struggling to understand the "vocabulary" of Ruby and the general flow of
movement of information as it goes through the code.  I'm slowly starting to grasp the concepts, but just barely.

I also made a huge mess of my files and directories and I'm having to sort it out.  So far... mild success.  My biggest issue is reconnecting the connection between local and remote repos.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

They are kind of like little machines you build that you can use later to solve specific problems. You can change the arguments you pass into
them, but they method will still work as designed.  This save having to duplicate that code later on.
